# Spotify Network Visualization

A interactive web application that visualizes Spotify user networks using D3.js, showing relationships between users and their cliques (strongly connected components).

To run, look at scraper.py. You need a list of spotify ids. I recommend running once for a user and obtaining all of the spotify ids. After creating the network.json, run process_graph.py to process the data.
